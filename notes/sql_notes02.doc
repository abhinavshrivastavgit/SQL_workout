*Filtering & Logic*

The Concept (The Highlighter)
Command: WHERE Condition;

    Analogy: WHERE is the Highlighter. It allows you to ignore the noise and focus only on the specific rows (sentences) that matter
   Query:
       SELECT user_id, country, price_paid
       FROM app_users
       WHERE last_active > '2026-01-01';


1. AND (The "Strict" Filter)
    Purpose: Narrow down results by requiring all conditions to be met.

    Query:
      SELECT user_id, country, subscription_plan 
      FROM app_users 
      WHERE country = 'India' AND subscription_plan = 'Pro';

2. BETWEEN (The "Range" Filter)
    Purpose: Select data within a specific numerical or date range.

    Query: 
      SELECT user_id, signup_date, price_paid 
      FROM app_users 
      WHERE price_paid BETWEEN 400 AND 1000;  

3. IN (The "List" Filter)
    Purpose: Check if a value matches any entry in a predefined list.

    Query:
      SELECT user_id, city, subscription_plan 
      FROM app_users 
      WHERE city IN ('London', 'Berlin', 'New York'); 

4. LIKE (The "Pattern" Filter)
    Purpose: Search for specific strings using wildcards (%).

    Query:
      SELECT user_id, country, subscription_plan 
      FROM app_users 
      WHERE country = 'India' AND subscription_plan = 'Pro';  

5. OR (The "Inclusive" Filter)
    Purpose: Expand results by allowing any one of multiple conditions to be true.

    Query:
      SELECT user_id, subscription_plan, price_paid 
      FROM app_users 
      WHERE subscription_plan = 'Enterprise' OR price_paid = 0;
