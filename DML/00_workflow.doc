we do have an option to option to add our data in pre- existing tables in the existed dataset.
but I am going to create new table in the database "My_Database"
so , flow will be:-
 1).Create a table in the database let name it as "details" [01_createTable.sql]
 2).Now we will verify the table we create in step 1 [00_verify_steps.sql]
 3).Inserting data in our table [02_insert_data.sql]
 4).Now we will verify the table we create in step 3 [00_verify_steps.sql]
 5).task01
     a.) first we delete the table[00_verify_steps]
     b.) Now we will compare the column of content from the table "persons"
         -> SELECT *
         -> FROM persons
     c.) Now, our table "details" is empty now what we will just to make a copy of the data from the table "persons" we want in our empty table "details"[task01.sql]
         USE MyDatabase

         INSERT INTO details (id, country, full_name, designation , score)
         SELECT 
             id,
             country,
             first_name AS full_name,     --as detail table have column is having full_name column but persons have first_name.
             NULL,                        -- as person table is not having designation column like details column.
             score
         FROM customers
     d.) Now we will verify our data is it there or not. [00_verify_steps]
