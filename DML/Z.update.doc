update syntax

UPDATE table_name
 SET column1 = value1,
     column2 = value2
WHERE <condition>

NOTE:- Always use WHERE to aviod UPDATING all rows unintentionally

Warning:- without a where all rows will be updated !
ex:
UPDATE world_leaders
 SET score =0 
 
 --> the thing will happwn that scores of all will be zero
